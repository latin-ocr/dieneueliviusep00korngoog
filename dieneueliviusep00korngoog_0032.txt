The idea then was that the Erasinus, consisting oi waters derived
from the Stymphalian lake, was the male (ποταμός) driven forth by the
female (λίμνη). Nor was this more tartetched than other interpretations
of oracles.

Tbat it was an interpretation not imagined at Delphi need hardly
be said3 and it mperhaps futile to speculata what meaning or meanings
Delphi may have contemplated. But itis worth pointing out that the
snake seems to have been an emblem or symbol ot Sparta.¹) Ii Sparta
had been defeated, the ὄφις might have been thus interpreted.

ξ 5. Legsnd ot Telesilla.

This oracle may be partly responsible tor the growth ot a story
unknown to Herodotus which, it it were true, would explain the tailure
oi Cleomenes atter the battle ot Sepeia. The story was preserved by
the Argive historian Socrates in his Περιήγησις Ἄργους, and was often
cited asan example ol female valcur. It has come down to us through
Pausaniae, Plutarch, Polyaenus, and Suidas.²) According to tbis tradition,
the Argive women, at the instigation oi the poetess Telesilla, defended
their city against the attack ot the Spartans, Some historiens bave
thought that there may be a measure of truth in this traditioni) but it
seeum quite improbable that such a remarkable achievement should not
bave been noiscd about Graece and come to the ears ol Herodotus. It
could not have been hidden, and any Spartan version oi the campaign
must have taken account ot it. Those who regard it as alate invention .
are assuredly right.⁴) There were perhaps three motives which determined
the shape ottho story. (1) It assigned an origin for the annual least
ot Hybristika, at which the women dressed as men and the men as
womenl) (2) Pausanias states that the statue ot Telesilla stood in
tront of a temple ot Aphrodital) and Famae acutely suggests that this
