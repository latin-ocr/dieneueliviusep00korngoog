was fought at Sepeia1) near Tiryns Cleomenes taking his ioes unawareS,
aud when some oi the Argives iled into the sacred grove oi Argus, the
Lacedaemonians surrounded it aud set it on fire. 'lhis overwhelming
defeat in which the Argives lost the greater part of their male popu·
lation should, i¹ might be thought, have exposed their city delenceless
to the victor, yet Cleomenes returned home without capturing ita) Such
is the general outline oi the campaign, stript oi all the problematical or
clearly unhistorical details which beset the narrative of Herodotus.

ς’ 2. Tho oplcoua oraclo: what was its metiret-

'Phe epicene oracla on which our dating ol the battle ol Sepeia
depeuds is, when one comesto consider it, extremely curicus, I need
not elaborate the point that it is quite inconceivable that a single joint
answer should have been given to Argiva and Milesion θεοπρόποι coming
independently to consult the god, each about their own affairs3 since
Herodotus-although in the passage where he quotes the Argivo part
of the oracla he speaks as il this had been the case³)—expressly states
in the passage where he quotes the Milesian portion, that the oraclo
was given to the Argives and the llilesians were not present. ln other
words, it was the Argives only who eousulted the Oracle; Miletus (as
we might expect) addressed no inquiry to Delphi.

'Phe matter oi the Argiva inquiry was περὶ σωτηρίης τῆς πόλιος
τῆς σφετέρησ,*) when they were threatened by a Spartan invasion. Ac·
cording to Herodotus, the reply ol the Pythia was as follows:

ἀλλ’ ὅταν ἡ θήλεια τὸν ἄρσενα νικήσασα
ἐξελάσῃ καὶ κῦδος ἐν Ἀργείοισιν ἄρηται,

πολλὰς Ἀργείων οίμιγιὸρνφέας τότε θήσει.

ὥς ποτε τις ἐρέει καὶ ἐπεσσομένων ἀνθρώπων
“ὃεινὸς ὄφις ἁέλικτος ἀπώλετο δουρὶ δαμασθείς”.
καὶ τότε δή, Μίλητε κακῶν ἐπιμήχανε ἐργων,
notaverant) δεῖπνόν τε καὶ ιἰγλαιὶ δῶρα γενήσῃ,
σαὶ ὁ· ἄλοχοι πολλοῖσι πόδας νίψουσι κομήταις,
νηοῦ δ’ ἡμετέρων Διδύμοις ἄλλοισι μελήσει.

ἸῚιω oraele is mot complete, iar it eumd not have begua with ἄλλα.

l) Ἡσίπεια in the Μαι. ol Herod. 6, ii.

2) He was aeeused at Sparta of δωροδοκία and ricquitted. 'Phe Spartan iuformauts
oi Herodotus inscribed to Cleomenes an explanation, which is really uo explanation
(6, 62).

3) ἐπίκοινα ἔχρησε 6, 77.

4) 6, 19 inte.

5) Oracularly vague. ls any correction is required I suggest πτανοῖσιν, which is
(l) palaeographieully better, (2) more oracular, thau v. llsawsnusss ὄρνισιν.
