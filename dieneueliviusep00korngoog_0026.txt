The Epicene Oracle concerning Argos and Miletus
ny ο. Β. Bury.

ξ l. The Argiva campaign ot Cleomenes.

lt is now generally agreed that the decisive defeat which Cleomenes
of Sparta inflicted upon Argos occurred at the time of the Ionio revolt.
The main ground for this dating is the curious oracle quoted by Hero·
dotus as having been delivered ut Delphi “to the Argives and Milesians
in common”,¹) though “the Milesians were not presentes) apparently not
long before* the capture of the Ionian cityl) The trnth ot this syn·
chronism is corroborated by other considerations,⁴) while there is nothing
to be said in favour of the statement of Pausanias that the Argive
campaign of Cleomenes belonged to tho early years of lris reign.⁶)

All that we know ot the campaign oan be told in a few words.
Huving instructed his Aeginetan and Sicyonian allies to send ships to
the Cynnrian coast, Cleomenes at the head ol a Lacedaemoniun army
marched into Argolis as far as the banks ol the river Erosium, but
did not cross it, forbidden by unfavourable diabateria. So he gave out;
so the Argives believed, and, aa they saw his army withdraw into Cymnria,
imagined that the danger was over. But the demonstration at the
Erasinus was only a teint‚‘³) and the unfavourable sacrifice served the
strategy of the Spartan king. 'Phe Aeginetan and Sicyonian vessels were
already waiting,⁷) to transport his host across to Nauplia. une battle

3) This does not 'follow from the words of Herodotus (6, 18) ἠνδραποδίσαντο τὴν
πόλιν ὥστε συμπεσεῖν τὸ πάθος τῷ χρηστηρίῳ τῷ ἐς Μίλητον γενομένῳ, for συμπεσεῖν
need not mean “coincide chronologically”‚ bnt simply “fnlfil'’. But it is reasonable to
infer that when tho oraclo was given Miletus was either besieged or menaced.
