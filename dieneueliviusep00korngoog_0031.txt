ξ 4. Argivo Interpretatlon ottho oraclo.

There is one remarkable sentence in the narrative of Herodotus, which
commentators have omitted to explain. Ταῦτα δὴ πάντα συνελθόντα
τοῖσι Ἀργείοις φόβον παρακοὴ “The conjunctior ot all these things caused
alarm to the Argives’' then encamped close to Sepeia. Ταῦτα πάντα
refers to the oracle Just quoted and manifestly means that certain signs
indicated therein had come to pass. Now the oraole indicates two signs.
(1) It declares that many Argive women will be ἀμφιδρυφέας,

ὅτανὴ θήλεια τὸν α’ρσενα νικήσασα

ἐξελάσῃ καὶ κῦδος ὲν Ἀργείοισιν ἄρηται,
and (2) it implies a second τέκμαρ in
δεινὸς ὄφις &maroch

How were these portenta realised in the opinion oi the Argives?
Herodotus does not tell us, and as it ‘s not like him not to explain such
a matter, perhaps he missod the point; but his narrative enables us to
discover. The portent ot the ὄφις was discerned in the place ot en·
campment‚ aplace ot snaky name, Σήπτια, which in very fact may been
so called troni local abundance of σῆττες. 'Phe seps is a dangerous viper
common in the eastern Peloponnesus and legend said that Aepytus was
killed by its bitel) The place ot snakes was in danger3 that was one sign.

But in what sense could the Argives suppose that the female had
expelled the male and won glory among them. 'Phe only glory that had
yet been won among the Argives in this campaign, so far aa the story
tells us, had been won by the river Erasinus, which (by the nnfavourable
sacrifices) bad turned the invader back. But Erasinus was male: what
ot the female? Herodotus, unconsoiously as it seemS, supplies us with
the answer. He describes the Erasinus thus⁴):

Ἐρασῖνον ὃς λέγεται ῥέειν ἐκ τῆς Στυμφαλίδος λίμνης· τὴν
γὰρ δή λίμνην ταύτην ἐς χάσμα ἀφανὲς ἐκδιδοῦσαν ἀναφαίνεσθαι ἐν

——-.-——-— --

2) The epithet ἀίίικτος has not been rightly interpreted. It hasbeen taken as
simply equivalent to the inferior variant τριέλικτος (d-s‘ntcaoioum). Not so. The natural
meaning (ἀ-ιιιροίίνναι) is the right one. ὄφις ἀέίικτος “Οοί11οοο snake”‚ “snake not a
snnke'’, is a phrase of the same kind as πῦρ ἀνήφσιιστον, βάκχῃ ἄθυρσοι, ἄρδις ἄπορος,
etc. - a metaphorioal expression applicablc to many things and suitable in an
ambiguous prophecy. Of course, ii the need arose, Delphi could interpret the prefix
as intensive.

3) Pausanias describes it from his own observation, 8, 4. 73 compare Fnszsns note
od loc. Mount Sepeia iu Arcadia probably got its name from the samo cause. -
Maesa (note on Herod. 6, 77. 13, p. 336 h) notes that “Sepeia or Hesepeia is another
point of suggestion between the oracle and the event (σήψ = ὄφις)”, but should have
added that it must have been this suggestion which contributed to tho alarm of the.
Argives.
