Herodotus has omitted the beginning ¹) and was apparently unconscious
oi the omission.

But how are we ιο explain the portion-the greater portion, un·
doubtedly—whioh he has quoted? What had Miletus ιο do with Argos?
How was the iate oi Miletus pertinent to the inquiry oi the Argives
about the saiety oi their city? So iar as the Herodotean narrative goes
no connexion whatever is indicated. lt seems to me quite outside the
range oi probability that the Pythian priestess and her prompters were
ever in the habit oi adding gratuitously to their official replies expressions
of opinion or prophetie intimations conceming irrelevant affairs. Gods
and their interpreters move doubtless in mysterious ways, but to suppose
that the Pythia, consulted as ιο the saiety oi Argos would have digressed
upon the peril oi Miletus, seems somewhat as ii—it is hard to think
oi a modern illustration—, as ii we were ιο suppose an “internetional”
authority ol the present day, say Professor Martem, when asked his
opinion on the delimitation oi Veneznela, turning asido to discuss a crisis
in (lhina.

Nor would the difficulty be lessened by the assumption that the
oraole was compiled, or rather tempered with, aiter the event. 'Phe
whole subject oi oracles port wentam is extremely obscure, and, when
this question arises in regard ιο Delphic χρησμοί, we have to do, so far
as I can J‘udge, less often with oracles entirely invented aiter the event
than with interpolations in oracles actually delivered.'²) Now we might
assume that the Argive portion oi this oracle was original and genuine,
and that the παρενθήκη (as Herodotus calls it) about Miletus was a
subsequent addition. But ii the Delphic priesthood‚ in order ιο strengthen
the credit oi their shrine, issued (in collections oi Delphic χρησμοί, we
should have ιο suppose) partially spurious oracleS, it is higMy unlikely
that they would not have taken care that in point oi tbrm such eracles
should be periectly regular and beyond suspicion.

In the actual contents oi the oracle which we are considering, there
is nothing really inconsistent with the implication oi Herodotus that it
was given shortly before the Argive war and the capture oi Miletus.
The oracular utterance is ambiguous there is no unequivocal indication
oi the eventi) At the time when it was pronounced, Delphi was pro·

l) Which need not have consisted of inore than two verses or conceivably one.

2) Thus the gra l. of the creole to Cypselus in llerod. 5, 925 (ep. Maces ad loc),
tha last 5 lines of the oracla to the Atheniens, ib. 7, 111 (cp. lenuowrrz, Ass
Kydatben, 973 Bam, Aristides at Salamis, in Chamicul licoicre, Ilcc. 1896 p. 417).
οο ιιο other hand the oracle 1ο the Spartans, ib. i’, 220, seems entirely a concoctiou
er eventu.

3) So Macra rightly, note on 6, 19 (p. 282ι); “nor does the oraele here given
commit Delphi so deeply us to be beyond the resources of interpretation, whatever the
everrt”. But one line may be an interpolation (see below, ς’ 6).
