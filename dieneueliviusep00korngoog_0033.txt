§b 'l'lre relations nimietas, Branchidae, and Delphi: a problem.

The Milesian verses still call ior criticism. It seems possible that
one ot these verses, viz:

σαὶ δ’ ἄλοχοι πολλοῖσι πόδας νίψουσι κομήταις,

may be an interpolation ea eneam, but there is not the sligbtest reason
to suspect tbe restl) The words ἄλλοισι μελήσει are typically maculer,
being susceptible oi opposite interpretatione amodum wmtum: (1) will
be saved by others (than the Argives), (2) will occupy the attention oi
the Persians. Yet it is implied that the god is interested in the fate
oi his sanctuary, and the words are clearly intended to suggest that the '
temple of Branchidae will be a care to friends. Itis mfficmt not to
suspect that there is some allusion to measures which were being taken,
with the eognisanee oi Delphi, for the benefit oi Didyma. That Didyma
looked up with respect to Delphi, we bave evidence in the circumstance
that the Branchidae derived their origin hom the Delphian Machaereus;⁴)
while this χρησμός, at least patna ἴασίν, attests the goodwill of Delphi
to Didyma.

On the other hand wc find Miletus designated by a strong and
almost startling phrase oi censure, κακῶν ἐπιμήχανε ἔργων, which implies
that Miletus bad offended the god or his interpretem. But how? Itis
quite useless to take it ior a condemnation oi the revolt itseli‚ though
the revolt may have seemed to Delphi, as to Hecataeus (and to Herodotus
ec ινιιιιιι), unwise.⁵) l'he phrase must refer to some special and serious
offence. Maean throws out the suggestion that the words are levelled
at Hecataeus who proposed that the treasures oi Branchidae should be
