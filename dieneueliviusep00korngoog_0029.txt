bably convinced that the fall of the Ionian city was inevitable; but
even ii tha uniorcseen had beiallen and Miletus had escaped, the veracity
of the Delphian god would not have been compromised3 there was a
long capacious future still ior the evil city to iuliil its destiny. As for
the Argivo portion, the phrases are so ingenioosly obscure that they
could cover any and every occurrence. Had the oracle been iorged
afterwards, there would assuredly have been some less equivooal reference
to actual events. So lar as internal evidence goeS, tha assumption of
a post meatum origin is unnecessary, and therefore nntenable. The
problem is to discover the motii underlying the colligation oi Miletus
and Argos.

At the beginning of the fifth century the position ol Sparta was
this. She had failed repeatedly, and her iailures hod been humiliating‚
to control the developement of Athens. She saw that, before she could
interfere effectually in the affairs oi central Graece, she must rule with
undispnted sway in the Peloponnesns; and to attain this object, the first
and most important step was to bring to her ieet her diminished but
still independent and formidable rival, Argos, The words which Hero·
dotus ¹) puts into the mouth oi Aristagoras when urging Cleomenes to
assist the Ionians: χρεόν ἐστι ὑμέας μα’χας ἀναβάλλεσθαιι πρός τε
Μεσσηνίους ἐόντας ὶσσπαλέας καὶ Ἀρκάδας τε καὶ Ἀργείους, - these
words (apart from the anachronism ἰσοπαλέας Μεσσήνιοι) express the
situation. A war with Argos was imminent, and this circumstance was
probably the reason which weighed most with the Spartan govemment
when it declined to help Ionia.

When Aristagoras visited European Graece, probably in the first
months oi 498 B. t}.‚·²) did he apply for help only to Sparta and Athens?
'Phis is in the highest degree unlikely. We may be snr'e that he left
no stone unturned‚ - that he sought assistance for Miletus (which, as
the Milesians knew well, would soon be besieged by a Persian army) from
all the more powerlul Greek states on the Aegaeon side of Greece. Hero·
dotus mentions only his visits to Sparta and Athens3 bnt this is a case
where the general circumstances and probabilities oi the situation are
