aud sources are such as those of Herodotus.¹) We cannot doubt, ior
instance, that the Milesiam err-tyrant paid apersonal visit to Eretria and

moved the Eretricus to send their five triremem) And we might be
morally certain, a priori, that he could not have omitted to make an
application tor help to Argos. 'lhat he actually made such an appli-

catiou, the oracle under consideration seems to me to be the proof. For
etas oraclo ris explicoblc only on tlte assumptrba Mat tlte Maiestam alred
Argoa to acad help.³)

It would perhaps have been out ol the question for Argos with the
best goodwill in the world, to have acceded to the Milesion appeal, con·
scions as she must have been that at any moment she might be exposed
to Lacedaemoniam hostility. But the lact that Ionia had been partially
colonised from Argolis was in itseli sufficient to enlist sympathy, aud, if
Aristagoras visited Argos aiter the rebuff at Sparta, Argiva sympathy
would have been the more easily awakened. Argos then, we may take
it, showed her goodwill by not summarily refusing the Milesion request,
but promising to be guided ογ the counsel oi the Delphic god. Her
inquiry, Herodotus sayS, was περὶ σωτηρίης τῆς πόλιος τῆς σφετέρης. We
may inter that the Argive θεοπρόποι asked whether their city would
be saie if a contingent were sent to the help ol Miletus.

I will deal first with the verses concerning Argos and then with
those concerning Miletus But I may point out here that the oracle
presupposes that Miletus itself is directly menaced. Hence it might be
thought that the oracle must have been given shortly before the battle
oi Lade, which (according to the only reasonable chronology, in my
opinion) belongs to 494 Β. C. But there was in 498 Β. C. an earlier
siege oi Miletus,⁴) which is entirely omitted iu the superficial narrative
oi Herodotus, and the fact illuminatos the obscure campaign ol that year.
'Phe obiect ot the Greek march ou Sardis was to raise the siege. It
was in fact inevitahle that Miletus, the centre and leader of the rebellior,
should be the first objectiva oi the Persian generals. And Delphi, well
informed, was quite aware ol this at the beginning oi 498 B. l'.

l) The Spartan source of the Herodotean account of the visit of Aristagoras ia
reflected clearly in 5,39; Aristagoras sailed to Lacedaemon, idas γὰρ δὴ συμμαχίης
τινος οἱ μεγάλης ἐξευρεθῆναι.

a) nerse. s, so.

3) lt would, of course, be possible to suppose that at some later date in the
course oi the lorric revolt (say 495 Β. C.) the louians, hard pressed, made another
appcal to their European hrethreu, and that on thia occasion Argoa consultcd the
oraclo. But aa uo such appeal is recorded, it would he a violation of scientilic method
to multiply hypotheses.

4) Recorded ογ Plutarch, De oroloyaitatc Herod, 24, probably οιι the authority
of Charon of Lampsacus. 'Pho record was rightly accepted by Gaora cap. XXXV.
