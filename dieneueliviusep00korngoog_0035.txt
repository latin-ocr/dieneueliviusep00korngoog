sle Epiccnc Oroete conccrainp Arpos ond Miletus. 23

But there is one clement in the record ot Strabo which deserves
attention and can hardly have been invented, —perhaps it rests ulti-
mately on the authority ot Hecataeus It is the imputation of “sacrilege
and treachery’‘ to the Branchidae, and the implication that they teared
the vengeance oi Miletus. Here is an enigma3 and its solution, it we
knew it, might bear closely upon the matter in hand; ior the olience of
the Branchidae must have been prior· to the tall oi Miletus.

We have in fact a problem with three elements: (1) the alleged
treachery ot the Branchidae and the resentment ot Miletus; (2) the
host-ile altitude oi Delphi to Miletus3 and (3) its protective attitude to
Branchidae. Now consider the situation in which the priesthood ol the
Didymaeon were placed at the close ot 499 Β. C. On one hand, it had
been proposed by an influential citizen oi Miletus to tamper with the
sacred treasures, and, although the proposal had not been adopted, there
was only too good reason to tear that it might, under stress ot circum·
stances, be adopted at any moment. On the other hand, there was the
danger thal when the Persians came, as they would presently come, and
laid siege to Miletus, the sanctuary would be seized and spoiled. The
priests were between the devil and the deep sea. Obviously it is a possible

solution of our problem that, placed iu a grave dilemma, the priests ot
Didyma formed the plan of removing the treasures secretly trom the
temple ont oi the reach ot Milesian friends and Persian ioes alike,¹) and

that they took the priests oi Delphi into their confidenoe. By this hypo-
thesis we can explain both the animosity of Delphi towards Miletus aud
the animosity ot Miletus towards the Branchidae.

,ξ 7. Aa adventurous theory.

We shall never know the truth. But I must refer to an ingenious
theory propounded by c. Nrrsnnn,‘²) which bears upon this question,
though he approaches it from a different side. He points out that there
is something very odd about the dedicatory oilerings oi tharsus which
were shown to Herodotus at Delphi. Many ot them, Herodotus saysll
were uninscribed3 that is in itselt strange, as dedicatione usually bore
the names of the donors. One of thern, a gold perirranterion, was inscribed
with the name oi the Lacedaemonians; whereby, ot course, hung a tale.

l) It is hardly necessary to remark that the συληθέντα ot' Herod. 5, 19 cannot
reasonably be pressed against this supposition. Herodotus, ca hypothesi, kuowing
nothing of the secret history of the treusures assumed that they were in the sanctuary
when the Persians selred and burned it. Nor, u it comes to that, does the theory
imply that all the things ot' salue were removed.
