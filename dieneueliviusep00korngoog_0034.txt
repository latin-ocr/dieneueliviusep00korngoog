confiscated and used 111111 war.¹) This conjecture may seem insufficient3
for the proposal 11 111 citizen would not involve the city in the offense,
seeing that the city rejected the proposal. But nevertheless the sng-
1111111 supplies the clue. Though the 1111111111 rejected the idea 11
Hecataeus at the outset, yet the Branchid priests knew well that, as
time went on and the Milesians were hardpressed, the temptation to
forget their scruples and borrow the temple-treasuren would become almost
irresistible — especially as there was the cogent argument that, 11 they
did not themselves use them, the precious things would 1111 into the
hands 11 111 11111153) Certainly, it would have been surprising sell-
denial 11 111 1111111111 persisted in their resolution up 11 111 final
catastrophe. Hence it is a reasonable conjecture that, when the oracle
was given 11 111 Argives it was known at Delphi that the men 11
Miletus contemplated, or the Branchid priesthood apprehended, a seizure
or forced loan 11 Didymaean treasures.

Now Herodotus records that, aiter the iall 11 Miletus, the temple
and 111111 11 Didyma were plundered and bumt.³) He adds that the
1111111111 who were taken alive ἤγοντο ἐς Σοῦσα, 111 says nothing 11
111 1111 11 111 Branchidae in particular. Strabo, on the other hand,
states ⁴) that the temple was bmnt by Xerxes and that the Branchidae
delivered up the treasures to him (11111 Salamis) and went with him 11
Persia in order to escape punishment 111 their treachery.⁵) As we have
no other evidence, we must prefer the authority 11 Herodotus, general
probability being entirely in his favour. Strabo’s testimony (whatever
his authority) is specially impaired by his statement that the other Greek
temples 11 111 Asiatic coast, except that 11 Ephesus, were bmnt by
Xerxes This we must unhesitatingly regard as erroneous. Herodotus
11111) 1111 111 temples 11 111 Greek rebels (the Sauriam excepted) were
bumt by Darius. 11 111 new templeS, erected in the course 11 111
ensuing 11111111 years had been hurned by Xerxes in 480119 B. C. 1111111
would assuredly have been known 11 Η11111111 111 1111111 11 him. But
the act thus ascribed to Xerxes would in the circumstances have been
so impolitic that it is quite ineredihle. We cannot doubt that Herodotus
is right and that Darius burned the temple. Strabo’s record eonlnses
Darius with Xerxes
