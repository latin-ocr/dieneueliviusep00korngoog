As to the others (the gold hon, the plinths, the crateres, the casks, the
silver perimanterion) Herodotus does not say ¹) whether they hore the
name oi Drusus or not. Now in another passage,²) the historian makes
the remarkable statement that the otieriugs oi Croesus at Branchidae
were duphcates oi his offerings at Delphi, equal in number and like iu
kind. This sounds in itseli highly improbable, and the improbability
would he greater iib'mnunn is right iu his conclusion “dass Branchus zar

At all events, the statement reflects a strange hght on the Delphin
account oi the relations ot Delphi with Crcesus. According to that
account, when thasus tested the eracles and Delphi gave a true answer,
Croesus presented the rich offerings which Herodotus describes Are we
to suppose that at the same time he presented olferings of eqnal value
to Branchidae, which had failed to stand the test? The only way out
would be to suppose that he bestowed on Delphi a duplicate of every
dedication he had oliered at Didyma during the previous years oi his
reign. A fantastic suppositioni

Nmsnnns theory is that the olierings which Herodotus saw at Delphi
were indeed genuine ollerings of CrnsuS, but ollerings dedicated to the
Didymaean, not to the Delphian, Apollo. In other words, some ol the
treasures oi Didyma had been conveyed surreptitiously to Delphi, and
the inscriptions had been erased Ι do not propose to discuss Nmunws

speculation,⁴) which involves Aristagoras and the Alcmaeonids in a
conspiracy to plunder Didyma, and makes Delphi an accessory aiter the
fact. The use ol such divination is to illustrate aud accentuate a problem,
where there is no positive evidence. There is a mystery about the last
days oi Branchidae, which will probably never be cleared up, aud
Nmaunn has done service in pointing it out, though his tissue oi combi-
nations haugs suspended in the aire)

l) lt cannot he inferred from the expression tilia οὐκ ἐπίσημα πολλά, that the
gold lion etc. were ἐπίσημα, for οὐκ ἐπίσημα need ouly distinguish the objecta which
it includes from the perimauterion 'of the Lacedaemoniaus'’.

2) l. 92 ἴσα τε σταθμὸν καὶ ὁμοῖα. Cunmus finds this quite natural (Griech.
Gcscb. 1⁸ 564).

3) Ρ, 23.

4) I may point out that he has omitted to observo that there is earlier evidence
than Herodotus -earlier by more than 20 years - for the Delphic dedicatione oi
Crtnsus, -the ssfdpoem of Bacchylides 468 Β. C.; and Pindar's somewhat earlier
Κροίσου φιλόφρων ἀρετά iu a Pythian ode (l. 943 470 B. C.) must allude to them.

5) Itis always instructive lor studente of Greek history to observo how problems
strike orientalists. One of Nrennnns points is that his theory accounts for the anger
of Darius against the Atheniens, the king regarding them as participatam in the
robbery of Branchidae, und the anger of Darius is explained by an iriadequatc motive
in Herodotus. ,Die Motioirnny des lconiyls'chen Zorues crreyt bei p'edcm Kenucr dea
